# SRFI 175 implementation

To compile the code:

    ./compile-$x.sh

To run the code in an interpreter:

    ./run-$x.sh tests
    ./run-$x.sh examples

The tests produce no output if they pass. Any failed tests are
reported on standard output.

Before using a R6RS Scheme, set up compatibility shims with:

    ./r6rs-symbolic-links.sh

The library filenames required by many R6RS implementations are so
exotic that I did not commit them into version control, opting for
that script instead. On an OS that does not support symbolic links,
you can manually copy the files linked by that script into the right
locations.

If you edit the R7RS code, you can auto-convert it to R6RS:

    chibi-scheme r7rs-to-r6rs.scm

You can also run the converter in another R7RS Scheme, but the output
may not be pretty-printed.

Vicare does not flush its output ports before exiting, so you need

    (flush-output-port (current-output-port))

at the end of tests.sps and examples.sps.
